# simpleAnkiWeb

simpleAnkiWeb is a helper program that enables learning Anki cards on a Kindle Paperwhite (Gen 11+). 

# Why?
In my opinion, when learning on a laptop, cell phone, or tablet, it's easy to lose focus because there are so many distractions. In addition, my eyes get tired very quickly from regular displays. That's why I tried using [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net) in the Kindle web browser. Unfortunately, this browser is very stripped down, which is why AnkiWeb does not load. So I designed my own very simple version of this app, which I am providing here.

# Setup
TODO: Detailed instructions
1. Set up Anki instance with AnkiConnect
2. Set up Docker container with docker-compose.yml

# Contributions welcome!

I quickly put this program together in my free time, so it works, but it's not perfect. Therefore, I welcome any suggestions for improvement.
